General
==========

1️⃣ Advanced Two-Pointer / Sorting Problems

These appear in Google, Amazon, Uber.

✔ Must Do

Merge Intervals

Insert Interval

Non-overlapping Intervals

Meeting Rooms

Meeting Rooms II (Heap + array)

Boats to Save People (Greedy + sorting)

Minimum Number of Arrows to Burst Balloons

K closest points to origin (sorting + heap)

📌 Why important?
Real-life scheduling, merging, pairing — huge in product interviews.

2️⃣ Hard Sliding Window

These are very common in Meta/Google.

✔ Must Do

Fruit Into Baskets

Longest Repeating Character Replacement

Count Number of Nice Subarrays

Subarrays with K Different Integers

Longest Subarray with Absolute Diff ≤ Limit (used by Google)

📌 These teach dynamic window balancing — extremely powerful.

3️⃣ Advanced Prefix Sum / Hashing

These problems are extremely common in Amazon + Microsoft.

✔ Must Do

Maximum Size Subarray Sum Equals k

Binary Subarrays With Sum

Count Subarrays with Sum Divisible by K

Subarray Sums Divisible by K

Contiguous Array (very popular)

📌 These build strong subarray intuition — crucial.

4️⃣ Hard Binary Search Variants (Google level)

These questions are hard but if you master them, product companies become easy.

✔ Must Do

Kth Missing Positive Number

Kth Smallest Element in a Sorted Matrix

Median of Two Sorted Arrays (very high value)

Search a 2D Matrix II

Find K Closest Elements

📌 Binary search on answer + search space thinking.

5️⃣ Math + Array Hybrid Questions

These appear in Facebook (Meta)/Amazon.

✔ Must Do

Rotate Array (cyclic replacement)

Plus One

Add to Array-Form of Integer

Missing Number

Find All Numbers Disappeared in an Array

Find the Duplicate Number (Floyd cycle detection!)

📌 Very important for reasoning skills.

6️⃣ Stack + Arrays (Very Important)

Asked by Google, Microsoft, Amazon.

✔ Must Do

Next Greater Element I

Next Greater Element II

Daily Temperatures (very frequent)

Asteroid Collision

Car Fleet

📌 Stack + arrays = advanced level mastery.

7️⃣ Simulation / Greedy + Arrays

These are tricky, common in top interviews.

✔ Must Do

Gas Station (greedy reasoning)

Candy (hard but common)

Jump Game

Jump Game II

H-Index

H-Index II (Binary Search)

📌 Every FAANG candidate should do these.

⭐ BONUS — Top 10 MUST DO HARD ARRAY PROBLEMS

For final polishing (Google/Meta level):

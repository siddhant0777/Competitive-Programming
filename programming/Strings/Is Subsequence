class Solution{

   public boolean isSubsequence(String s, String t){
      int len1=s.length();
      int len2=t.length();

      int i=0;
      int j=0;

      while(i<len1 && j<len2){
        if(s.charAt(i)==t.charAt(j)){

      return i==len1;
   }
}


============================

You have two strings:

s → a small word (what you want to find)

t → a big word (where you search)

Your task is to check:

“Can I find all letters of the small word in order inside the big word?”

⚠️ Important:

Letters must be in the same order

They do NOT have to be next to each other

Example
s = "abc"
t = "a h b g d c"


You can pick:

a → ✔

then b → ✔

then c → ✔

So "abc" is a subsequence of t.

🧠 How the Code Thinks (Very Simple)

Think of:

One finger on string s

One finger on string t

We move the fingers step by step.

🧩 The Code
class Solution {

   public boolean isSubsequence(String s, String t) {


👉 This function will return:

true → YES, it is a subsequence

false → NO, it is not

📏 Step 1: Measure the strings
int len1 = s.length();
int len2 = t.length();


We check:

How long is the small word?

How long is the big word?

👉 Step 2: Put fingers at the start
int i = 0;
int j = 0;


i → finger on small word (s)

j → finger on big word (t)

Both fingers start at position 0 (the first letter).

🔁 Step 3: Start walking
while (i < len1 && j < len2) {


This means:

“Keep walking as long as:

we still have letters left in s

AND letters left in t”

👀 Step 4: Compare letters
if (s.charAt(i) == t.charAt(j)) {
    i++;
}


This says:

“If the current letter of s and t are the same,
then move the finger on s forward.”

Why?

Because we found the letter we were looking for

🚶 Step 5: Always move in t
j++;


This means:

“Whether letters match or not,
always move forward in the big word.”

Why?

Because you are searching inside t

🏁 Step 6: Final check
return i == len1;


This means:

“Did we find all letters of the small word?”

If i reached the end → ✔ YES

Otherwise → ❌ NO

🧪 Simple Example Walkthrough
Input
s = "ab"
t = "axb"

Step-by-step
s[i]	t[j]	Match?	Action
a	a	✔	i++, j++
b	x	❌	j++
b	b	✔	i++, j++

Now:

i == len1 → ✔

Return true.

🎯 One-line explanation (child-friendly)

“We walk through the big word and try to find each letter of the small word in order.”
